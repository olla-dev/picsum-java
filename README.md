# picsum-java

This app load random images from picsum.photos

I tried to make it as simple as possible (One Activity, One Background service).
It does not use any external dependencies aside from the android sdk (it is of course possible to rely on libraries that handle caching images like glide)
For a more complex architecture, please see the other project (kittens-kt).
